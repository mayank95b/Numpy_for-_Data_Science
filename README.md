# Numpy_for_Data_Science

NumPy is an open source library available in Python that aids in mathematical, scientific, engineering, and data science programming. NumPy is an incredible library to perform mathematical and statistical operations. It works perfectly well for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices multiplication

### Features

    - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
    - It has a powerful N-dimensional Array Object called as ndarray and routine to manipulate it
    - It also has other derived objects like masked arrays ans matrices
    - NumPy is used by other libraries like Scipy, matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-image,Scikit learn, pandas to store the multi-dimensional data
